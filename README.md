# Oxygen_gradient_MS
Describing the ecology and biogeochemistry along an oxygen gradient in the Pacific subtropical gyre. 

Data were collected during the SE2204 reserch cruise onboard NOAA ship Oscar Elton Sette between June 20 and July 10, 2022. Sampling took place along 150W from 30N to 10N. A [summary of the project](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/49070) can be found in the NOAA Institutional Repository. All data are housed in google drive and all code to analyze data is available here.

Data collected during the cruise:
- ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler)
- TSG (Thermosalinograph)
- CTD (Conductivity Temperature Depth) casts to 1300 meters
- Nutrient (top 200m)
- Bulk chlorophyll (top 200m)
- Size fractionated chlorophyll (20, 2, and 0.2 um, top 200m)
- Flow cytometry (top 200m)
- Carbonate chemistry (top 200m)
- eDNA
- Fine-scale zooplankton composition and vertical distribution from CTD mounted UVP (Underwater Vision Profiler)
- Zooplankton fize fractionated biomass from bongo tows
- Zooscan data from bongo tows
- Ichtyoplankton from 200m ring net
- Depth discrete micronekton size and biomass from 1m MOCNESS
- Micronekton aboundance and species composition from 10' IKMT (Isaaks Kidd Midwater Trawl)
- Active acoustics
